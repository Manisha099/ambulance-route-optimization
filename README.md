Ambulance Route Optimization

This project finds the fastest route for an ambulance using Dijkstra's Algorithm. It helps reduce emergency response time by choosing the shortest path.

Features

Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm
Takes building and road data as input
Works with data from text files
Written in C++ using graph logic

How it works

Reads data from a file to create a graph
Runs Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path
Shows the route and travel time

Files

ambulance_route_optimizer.cpp - Main C++ code
buildings.txt - Map data
Dataset.txt - Input and output data
Work_Log.docx - Project log (optional)
Design_Document.docx - Project design (optional)

Technology

C++ programming
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Text files for input

How to run

Open terminal
Compile: g++ ambulance_route_optimizer.cpp -o ambulance
